                  <p>"Dogs are mans best friend!" I have always found this to be true. Growing up I have always had pet dogs. So, as I got to adulthood I got a dog of my own. His name is Virgo. He is a very intelligent dog, and knows many tricks. He can sit, lie down, roll over, stay, shake hands, and bark on command. Whenever I feel lonely or need some company he is there. And in return, he gets food :)</p>

                  <p>"Healthy body healthy mind." This is literally my mantra. I have always been quite active growing up, doing many sport activities. I now train to keep in shape. I try to go to the gym at least 4 days per week. Staying in shape is mainly down to your diet. So, I am also very strict when it comes to meals. I do meal prep once per week for the whole week. cooking at least 10 meals, where I try to do at least four different meals.</p>

                  <p>Growing up, I have always loved science, specifically Astronomy. I'd would always go stargazing with my grandparents when I went camping. So, it was no surprise that I went to studied Physics. I completed a project in Particle Physics, which I later specialised in. This is where I first encountered coding. I had to produce particle collision simulations to compare with real-world data in order to observe the Higgs boson. I used C++ to simulate the particle interactions. I had to teach this to myself.</p>

                  <p>I loved the process of learning to code so much, but i didn't know where I could go with it. Luckily, I had a few friends in tech that were able to point me in the right direction. I was introduced to Udemy and began a course on Full-stack web development in JavaScript, as I wanted to use my creativity as well. After completing the course in a Month I realised that it was something I wanted to do as a career. Because of this, I decided to take another, more complete course in Full-stack development with the Code Institute. Here I learnt mode advanced JS and also Python. As well as using new frameworks and libraries.</p>
